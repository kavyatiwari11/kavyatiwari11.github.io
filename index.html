    <p1> Hi! my name is Kavya. Let me tell you more about myself. </p1>
    <br>
    <p2> I was born on 18th of April 2011... many of you might be thinking how old am I if i was born in the year 2011
        right? Well I am 13 years old. It's hard for me to believe that i am officially a teenager! </p2>
    <br>
    <p3> My whole friend circle is younger than me one of my friends was born on 2016, which means she is currently 8
        years old! There is one girl who was also born on 2011 but she is younger than me in months if not years. </p3>
    <br>
    <p4> I have a big brother who is 11 years older than me and he is currently 23 years old! Can you even imagine?! He
        was 11 years old when I came into this world... </p4>
    <br>
    <p5> I have always wanted a pet cause I mean who doesn't like animals?? I eventually got a pet when I was about 8 or
        9 years old it was not a dog or a cat but a cute and fluffy rabbit! It was a he... we intentionally bought a
        male rabbit so that we won't have to worry about a lot of fluffy balls running around the house :) </p5>
    <br>
    <p6> We had to give him back because we found out that I was allergic to that fluff ball! Also because when he had
        to travel we can't take a rabbit with us everywhere we go because he was very small... which is no big plot
        twist :) </p6>
    <br>
    <p7> I had a rabbit for about 6 months :( plus whoever who was not expecting a fluff ball running around got pretty
        scared for example my cousins they came for the summer vacation my cousin brother was very scared at first he
        used to get on top of the sofa. ( thinking that the rabbit would not have been able to jump up the sofa ) So one
        day like usual I let the rabbit out of it's cage because obviously both my cousins jumped on the sofa ( again )
        this time I helped my rabbit jump on the sofa bacause I am such a good sister.</p7>
    <br>
    <p8> My cousin brother finally had some brain and thought that this cute fluff ball will not do anything unlike my
        cousin sister... I tried to do the same thing with my cousin sister and you could say that things did not go as
        planned. She was even more scared now than she initially was! </p8>
    <br>
    <p9> I got some more scolding for forcing my sister to love my rabbit ( BTW let's call her fluffy ). My cousin
        brother also betrayed me he suddenly changed sides and also "acted" to be scared of fluffy for which I got an
        extra scolding like a damn cherry on top! I knew that I had to plan a revenge so that's what I did :).
